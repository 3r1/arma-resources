other unused/previous/test huds to be added in the future

"simple" hud

    This hud splits user (currently set to ludicrous) and enemy cycle hud elements
        user cycle elements are larger for clarity
        additionally, simplified friends/enemies counter only displays on "user" cycle hud
        replace all instances of "ludicrous" in this file with your own name to utilize the larger cycle hud elements
            otherwise, you will have the same size rubber and brake meters as enemies ( still entirely useable, but with less features )

    This hud also has peripheral "warning" bars for brakes and rubber. Top is blue for brakes--it begins to become visibile at .0.35 brakes, reaching fullbright at 0.00. Bottom right and left are gradients from green to red for rubber which are invisible until 20%, amping up to fullbright at 70%, warning you that certain turns are no longer possible.

    The rubber number at the bottom is also gradiented from 0-5 based on severity. Due to code limitations, this is hard-coded to 5 rubber and is only valid for 5 rubber gamemodes.

    Above the <user> cycle is also a +/- value which is a consolidated version of the classic friends vs enemies counter. If it says +x your team is up by x players. Similarly, any -x is the quantity of players your team is down by.

    toggles for version 0.0.4:
        1 peripheral warning bars
        2 friends enemies (over cycle)
        3 name (enemies over cycle)
        4 static text (near map)
        5 map

    use an instant chat for /console toggle show_own_name
        to enable or disable the hud elements above your own cycle

    you may wish to place
        fadeout_name_delay 0.000001
        show_own_name 1
      in your autoexec
        fadeout_name_delay is used for floating enemy nameplate rubber/brake
            set to -1 to show ugly name
            set to extremely small value to show hud widgets(name immediately vanishes)
            set to 0 to hide all
        because a low value is required to enable enemy hud elements without the ugly player names, an instant chat set to /console toggle fadeout_name_delay will not work. Instead, setting one instant chat to /console fadeout_name_delay 0 and either another to the low value or gamemode specific cfgs that include fadeout_name_delay 0.000001 is recommended.

    Dig comparitor not included due to inconsistent/not-quite-deterministic game stuff(bugs?).
