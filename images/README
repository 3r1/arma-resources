    Using circle wheel models, visually shows center of each model. The center of each wheel is the center of each model (0,0,0).
    The three models are offset in souce from the base of the tail head as follows:
        cycle_body.mod:     no offset       (none)
        cycle_back.mod:     (0,0,0.73)      (up 0.73)
        cycle_front.mod:    (1.84,0,0.43)   (forward 1.84, up 0.43)
    Additionally, the wheel meshes rotate.
