This first model, packaged in a moviepack named "Simply Ludicrous"(Version 1) is an initial test concept modeled in a text editor. Gimp was used for creation of the textures. The wheel is an edit of pike's "donut" (spins and looks better in-game). The concept is a flat edge front that only barely passes through walls when touching to give you more precision.
