Textures and images fully made in GIMP.

Cycle body model made in text editor alongside gimp sketches for vertice and face references.

The concept is a flat edge front that only barely passes through walls when touching to give you more precision. .mod files used in order to utilize the default model's spinning wheels.

Front wheel mod file is empty, whereas cycle_rear.mod model is an edit of Pike's "donut" cycle model, used to learn how to write .mod files by hand and as the final rear wheel.

cycle_body.mod is a quadrilateral prism with one oblique edge given a slight curve with a larger center ring.
Feel free to take a glance at the file, it only has 12 vertices and then 16 faces(tris) organized in sets of two for each face.
Vertices 1-4 and 9-12 make up the two outer quadrilaterals.
Vertices 5-8 make up the center ring to add more dimension to the otherwise very flat quadrilateral prism.
The coordinates are (width, thickness, height) where thickness is left and right from the cycle wall.
Width and height extend positvely away from the cycle wall edge where the cycle begind.
